# Golden regeneration log

Append-only. One entry per deliberate regeneration of a pinned golden.

## bootstrap — initial Tier-A fixtures
- reason: initial creation of the six Tier-A block-detector goldens (T-95)
- cases: blocks_dense_ld, blocks_two_separated, blocks_gap_split, blocks_below_min_snps, blocks_monomorphic_window, blocks_single_typed_marker

## Batch B — Tier-B varitome_locule golden added
- reason: T-61 confirmed the reproducing params (flank_kb=144, ld_decay_kb=72.17); populated tests/golden/varitome_locule/expected_blocks.csv (Table S8 six MLM blocks, read back from an actual run). GOLDEN_LOCK recomputed to include it.
